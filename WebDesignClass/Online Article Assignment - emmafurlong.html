                    Road construction in Galena has been going on for more than 2 years now. They recently started construction in a second area of our town as well. They are fixing the main highway that runs through uor town to be safer for drivers and other people trying to get around town. They recently started construction on the new entrance to our town’s hospital. Both areas are on <b> Highway 20 </b>. Road construction has impacted many areas of Galena. Construction causes many backups on our highway and has even made unsafe conditions for drivers.

                    Students at GHS have been impacted by the construction in many ways. One student said <q> I was 10 minutes late to school on the first day of school because of the construction downtown. </q> This is something that multiple students at GHS have attested to. Many students in Galena also work downtown. The construction makes it tough for them to get to work on time. Our town is full of tourists so often the mix of tourists and construction make it hard to get around town. This is not ideal. The GHS Golf team experiences the construction on the other side of town every day. When attempting to get to golf practice on time everyday, many members of the boys and girls golf teams are stopped for long periods of time in the traffic stops created by the one lane construction on your way out of town. One golfer said <q> I don’t enjoy being late to practice everyday. It cuts into my time to get better and talk to my coaches </q>

                    While the construction will help the town in the long run, it has caused a lot of issues short term for the residents of Galena. The residents of Galena are excited to see the new roads and new hospital entrance, but currently are not excited about the tribulations that the road construction bring to their everyday lives.
